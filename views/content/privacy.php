            <h1>BEMIKAS' PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Bemika takes your privacy matters very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy (“Policy”). This Policy details how we receive, collect and use information in connection with our website located at www.Bemikasolutions.com (the “Website”), and other products and services provided by Bemika (the “Services”).</p>

<p>By visiting this Website or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy, as such Policy may be amended from time to time. Each time you visit this Website or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.</p>

<p>To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “Personal Data” in this Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, billing information, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information.
    </p>
<p>If you are a user accessing the Website or to the Services from America, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, please be advised that through your continued use of the Website and Services, which are governed by the law of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, this Policy, and our end user license agreement, you may be transmitting your personal information to countries (including the Netherlands) where laws regarding processing personal information may be different to the processing of personal information in your country and you hereby consent to such transmission of personal information.</p>
<h3>1. Collection of the Personal Data and use of collected Personal Data</h3>

<p>1.1 Bemika (henceforth just “Bemika”) collects, uses and stores your Personal Data in accordance with the Dutch Law on the Protection of Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data, as modified.</p>

<p>1.2 Bemika may use your Personal Data to:</p>

<p>Improve their Services.
    For the provision of Services and billing purposes.
    Detect misuse of its system and/or a customer account.
    Provide you with information relating to your account.</p>
<p>1.3 Bemika and any partner involved in providing the Services, will store your Personal Data no longer than the time necessary to provide Services and in any case no longer than the maximum period permitted by the local laws, rules and regulations on Personal Data protection.</p>
<p>2. Disclosure and sharing of your Personal Data</p>

<p>Bemika ensures the confidentiality of your Personal Data and will never disclose them to third parties without your consent, apart from the partners involved in providing the Services.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these partners involved in providing the Services will only receive the Personal Data required to perform Services. Bemika and its partners are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes.</p>

<p>Personal Data may additionally be communicated to any employee of Bemika or any partner involved in providing the Services. The communication to these third parties is limited to data necessary for the performance of their tasks for the same purposes as the one of Bemika.</p>

<p>Finally, Bemika complies with legally binding requests from the Dutch authorities to share data only in the case of a legal investigation. However, Bemika will never share the data with authorities without proper legal order.</p>
<p>3. Security of your Personal Data</p>

<p>Bemika uses standard security technologies and procedures to ensure the protection of your Personal Data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure or destruction.
    </p>
<p>Bemika takes security measures, such as technical and organizational measures against unauthorized or unlawful access to your Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to your Personal Data.</p>

<p>Any sensitive information, such as your credit card number are protected by encryption. The encrypted communication is established using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

<p>Indeed, SSL provides the secure exchange of data between two computers in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity of exchanged information and authentication by recognition of the identity of the program, the person or company with which the Personal Data is exchanged.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Bemika does not save the payment information, such as bank account numbers or credit card information. The payment information is being processed by Payment Providers.</p>
<p>4. Access to your Personal Data</p>

<p>You can request free access to your Personal Data processed and stored by Bemika.</p>

<p>Should you wish to access to, update, rectify your Personal Data at any time, for compelling and legitimate reasons relating to your special situation, the processing of any data on you, you may make a request in writing to us through our Contact Form.</p>
<p>5. Cookies, Clear GIFs and Other Automatically Collected Data</p>

<p>If you have permitted your computer to accept cookies, Bemika may use cookies on its Website. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at the Website. Cookies may be used to analyze the Website usage, improve content, customize the Website’s content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Website to other information about you, including your Personal Data. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Website. Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Website or certain areas or features of the Website.</p>

<p>Bemika may use “clear GIFs” (aka “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in its Web Site and/or in its communications with you to enable it to evaluate Website usage information about visitors to the Website, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Data.</p>

<p>Bemika servers may automatically collect data about your Internet address when you visit the Website. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the web site you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Services. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.</p>

<p>Bemika will not link any Personal Data, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of our Users.</p>

<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Website usage information may be performed on Bemika behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s).</p>
<p>6. Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</p>

<p>You may arrive at our Website from another website. In addition, our Website may contain links that will let you leave our Website and access another website. Websites linked to or from our Website are not under the control of Bemika and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy. Our Policy applies solely to Personal Data that is acquired on the Website or through your use of our Services, and/or your relationship with Bemika. We urge you to be careful when you enter any Personal Data online. Bemika accepts no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p>
<p>7. Changes to Policy</p>

<p>From time to time, Bemika may revise this Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices. However, we will not use your Personal Data in a way that is materially different than the uses described in this Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. We will send an email to all our active Users informing them on the update. Your continued use of the Website indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Website, or any other part of our Services.</p>
